            <p> Hello, my name is Joseph, and this is the game 4 PONG! You can play this 
                game solo, but I believe it's always more fun to play games with friends. In this 
                interactive game, up to four people can join in the action, each with their 
                own paddle! Or, if you prefer, you can simply play one-on-one with a friend:) 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> top paddle = left/right keys</li>
                <li> right paddle = up/down keys</li>
                <li>bottom paddle = v/b keys</li>
                <li>left paddle = w/s keys</li>
            </ul>
